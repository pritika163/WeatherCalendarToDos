# Getting Started with Create React App

 ### ‚ú® <ins>*INSPIRATION* </ins> 
- While planning for events, we might sometimes need to check the weather to make sure plans aren't spoiled thanks to mother nature. With this in mind we decided to create our weather calendar .
- With a built-in calendar app and to-do list we have tried to solve this issue.

### üí° <ins>*WHAT PROBLEM DOES THE PROJECT SOLVE?* </ins>
- The project helps to plan everyday activities in an organized manner.

- Easy to Access for everybody and helps in planning the day ahead of time.

- You can go to the *Calendar* section and click on the *weather* button to check the forecast for the next five days at any location.
- Then go to the *Todos* section to plan out your days.

### ‚ò†Ô∏è <ins>*CHALLENGES WE RAN INTO*</ins>
- We faced some trouble syncing the to-do list with the respective dates.
- We also ran into some issues during API integration.
